		<h2 class="title" ><b>																		About Me</b></h2>
			
	
	<p>
		Hi, my name is Jamie Skinner, I am a part time graphic designer and carpenter based in Haywards Heath.
		I am currently steadily building a selection of hand made bespoke wooden products to sell. 
	</p>
	
	<p>From my work I demonstrate my eye for design and love of wood through my products. Currently my main 
		products are beautiful, hardwearing end grain chopping boards. Eventually I will have a 
		more diverse range of products to share with you as I progress with my business.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	
		Feel free to contact me if you have a specific design or idea you would like, I will be happy to help.
</p>

	<h2 class="title"><b>																		About My Products</b></h2>
	
<p>
		Turnaround time for making a cutting board can take up to a week depending on design. 
		Products shown for sale are ready to ship out within 1-2 days. 
		Products out of stock can take up to a month to be made, photographed and put up on the website for sale. 
		If you would like a certain design in particular please get in contact. 
</p>
	
<p>
		My cutting boards are made from a variety of different woods ranging from European Beech, Scandinavian pine, Cherry, American Black Walnut and many more. 
		I choose woods based on their characteristics and quality to create superior products. 
		Each cutting board receives four small rubber feet that prevent the board from moving when in use and increase stability on uneven 
		surfaces, they are also less likely to scratch any surface they are put on.
</p>

<p>
		Each board is sanded smooth and then treated with food grade mineral oil (sometimes called butcher block oil), this protects and 
		extends the life of cutting board; for extra protection and durability the board also receives a special 
		blend of natural beeswax and oil, this protects the board from liquids.
</p>

    <h2 class="title" ><b>Why choose "End Grain" Cutting Boards?</b></h2>
			
	
	<p>
		
		The end grain of timber is a quite a bit harder than it's face grain, usually by around 1.5x times. 
		Although the end grain may be harder than it's face grain it has a lesser blunting effect on knife edges. 
		This is due to the orientation of the wood fibers, the fibers open up around the blade and can close up with 
		minimal damage to the wood making the cut almost invisible. In short the wood "self heals".
